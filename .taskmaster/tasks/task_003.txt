# Task ID: 3
# Title: Implement Webhook/Trigger for Automatic File Discovery and Manifest Registration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up a Supabase Storage webhook or trigger to detect new CSV uploads, extract organization_id from path, compute checksum, and register in etl_file.
# Details:
Use Supabase Edge Functions (TypeScript) to listen for storage object.created events. Parse file path to extract organization_id. Compute SHA256 checksum of file (using crypto.subtle or Node.js crypto). Insert entry into etl_file with status 'uploaded'. Ensure idempotency for reuploads (check checksum).

# Test Strategy:
Upload test files and verify etl_file entries are created with correct metadata and checksum. Simulate reupload and check for correct deduplication.
