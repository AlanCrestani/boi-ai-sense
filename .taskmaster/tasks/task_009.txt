# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement Observability: Metrics Dashboard and Alerting
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create dashboards for ETL metrics, error rates, processing times, and configure alerting for recurring failures.
# Details:
Integrate with Supabase Realtime or use a lightweight backend (e.g., Next.js API routes) to aggregate metrics. Use Chart.js or ECharts for dashboard visualizations. Track files per status, error rates, average processing time. Integrate Sentry for error monitoring. Configure alerts (email/Slack) for persistent failures or SLA breaches.

# Test Strategy:
Simulate error scenarios and verify dashboard updates and alert delivery. Validate metric accuracy against database state.
